/*
    Arithematic operations can be performed on more than one column to derive a desired single column as result. 

    This is usually achieved by the AS clause. Done by adding AS at the end of the arithematic statement and ending with
    desired name for the new output column 
    
    Note: This derived column is temporary as it only exisit during the period of the query result.
